# Update process

* copy new posts to posts.html
	* just use chrome inspector
	* make sure single posts (div.v1Nh3.kIKUG) are wrapped in (div.Nnq7C.weEfm)

* copy new images
	* chrome: save page as 'index.html'
	* copy images from index_files to project index_files
	* links in posts.html are automatically changed to local

* update posts.json (needed for post dates) by running `npm run scrape` (needs an up to date posts.html)

* update `project` and `categories` in main.js
